The real estate management does contain mainly two types one is the Buyer and the other will be 
Seller. Here Our main motto is to play the mediating role between those two persons. Generally real 
estate contains enormous amount of paper works and money transactions so to address all these 
challenges and make the selling and buying process easy some mediators or real estate mangers work 
for us. Here the buyer can use this platform to access the available Land or house for sale. Or else he 
can particularly give his requirements to the system and find his own requirements. Here the seller 
can use this platform to sell his properties such as House or Land whatever he wants to sell he can 
upload the particular properties complete details about the property in this Platform and he can easily 
address the buyers by this mediating platform. Here our platform acts as a mediator our platform 
mediate between the buyer and seller legally. When the seller contacts the mediator, the mediator will 
check the details of seller, after checking all details of seller, our platform will check for buyer who 
is interested to buy that property. If the buyer contacts the mediator, the mediator will take the 
requirements from the buyer, after receiving the requirements from the buyer, the mediator will search 
for seller by his requirements
